Let LLMs interact with websites through a simple interface.

## Short Example

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from browser_use import Agent

agent = Agent(
    task="Go to hackernews on show hn and give me top 10 post titles, their points and hours. Calculate for each the ratio of points per hour.",
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
)

# ... inside an async function
await agent.run()
```

## Local Setup

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
# To install all dependencies including dev
pip install . ."[dev]"
```

2. Add your API keys to the `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

E.g. for OpenAI:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

You can use any LLM model supported by LangChain by adding the appropriate environment variables. See [langchain models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/) for available options.

## Features

- Universal LLM Support - Works with any Language Model
- Interactive Element Detection - Automatically finds interactive elements
- Multi-Tab Management - Seamless handling of browser tabs
- XPath Extraction for scraping functions - No more manual DevTools inspection
- Vision Model Support - Process visual page information
- Customizable Actions - Add your own browser interactions (e.g. add data to database which the LLM can use)
- Handles dynamic content - dont worry about cookies or changing content
- Chain-of-thought prompting with memory - Solve long-term tasks
- Self-correcting - If the LLM makes a mistake, the agent will self-correct its actions

## Advanced Examples

### Chain of Agents

You can persist the browser across multiple agents and chain them together.

```python
from asyncio import run
from browser_use import Agent, Controller
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
load_dotenv()

# Persist browser state across agents
controller = Controller()

# Initialize browser agent
agent1 = Agent(
    task="Open 3 VCs websites in the New York area.",
    llm=ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620", timeout=25, stop=None),
    controller=controller)
agent2 = Agent(
    task="Give me the names of the founders of the companies in all tabs.",
    llm=ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620", timeout=25, stop=None),
    controller=controller)

run(agent1.run())
founders, history = run(agent2.run())

print(founders)
```

You can use the `history` to run the agents again deterministically.

## Command Line Usage

Run examples directly from the command line (clone the repo first):

```bash
python examples/try.py "Your query here" --provider [openai|anthropic]
```

### Anthropic

You need to add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to your environment variables. Example usage:

```bash

python examples/try.py "Search the top 3 AI companies 2024 and find out in 3 new tabs what hardware each is using for their models" --provider anthropic
```

### OpenAI

You need to add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your environment variables. Example usage:

```bash
python examples/try.py "Go to hackernews on show hn and give me top 10 post titles, their points and hours. Calculate for each the ratio of points per hour. " --provider anthropic
```

## 🤖 Supported Models

All LangChain chat models are supported. Tested with:

- GPT-4o
- GPT-4o Mini
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- LLama 3.1 405B

## Limitations

- When extracting page content, the message length increases and the LLM gets slower.
- Currently one agent costs about 0.01$
- Sometimes it tries to repeat the same task over and over again.
- Some elements might not be extracted which you want to interact with.
- What should we focus on the most?
  - Robustness
  - Speed
  - Cost reduction

## Roadmap

- [x] Save agent actions and execute them deterministically
- [ ] Pydantic forced output
- [ ] Third party SERP API for faster Google Search results
- [ ] Multi-step action execution to increase speed
- [ ] Test on mind2web dataset
- [ ] Add more browser actions
